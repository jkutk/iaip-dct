/**
 * This package's sole purpose is to enhance JTable and its TableModel with a way to
 * inform listeners about a data change event concerning a rectangular region of cells,
 * instead of just single cells, a range of rows in one column, or all cells.
 * 
 * WARNING: This will most probably produce undesired results if the order of columns is changed for any reason.
