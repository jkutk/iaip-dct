\begin_layout Abstract
This paper looks into methods of teaching Discrete Cosine Transformation
 (DCT) in the context of images.
 DCT is a mathematical transformation used in lossy compression of images
 and video.
 As such, it is a topic addressed in university curricula for computer science.
 While it is obvious to approach teaching DCT from a mathematical point
 of view, this approach is not well-suited for all students alike.
 We propose and develop a software application that supports students in
 learning DCT by offering an alternative, visual and interactive means to
 explore forward an inverse DCT on arbitrary images.
 We further provide exercises and concrete questions the students can work
 on, in order to deepen their understanding of DCT based on example images
 built into that software.

 The undergraduate curriculum for computer science at the Johannes Kepler

 reflects the relevance of this technique in the respective field.
 The curriculum comprises multiple classes where Discrete Cosine Transformation
 (DCT) is an important topic, for example, lectures and exercises on multimedia
 systems and a course on digital image processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From our first hand experience we know that the level of mathematical skills
 of students in these classes varies significantly, and so does their success
 in understanding DCT.
 Some colleagues struggle to get their heads around the role of coefficients
 in the frequency domain matrix and their role in the image domain matrix
 or vice-versa.
 Informal interviews suggest that most of these students are seeking a visual
 connection between the coefficients in the two domains.
 They express the desire to see such connections especially when DCT is
 applied to blocks of

 8 x 8 pixels during JPEG compression and decompression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to contribute teaching material for classroom demonstration, exercise
 assignments, and self-study, which aids in understanding DCT in a visual
 way.
 Our approach consists of two major parts.
 The first one is a software application that shows DCT in the context of
 image processing and JPEG.
 It offers an image representation of the spatial domain matrix and the
 frequency domain matrix.
 Its user interface allows for interactive manipulation of any coefficients
 in each matrix, respectively the images, using a brush metaphor controlled
 by the mouse pointer and other means.
 Changes in one domain trigger instant execution of the DCT, providing instant
 visual feedback in the other domain's image.
 The second part is this paper which briefly introduces the topic, explains
 the application and its user interface, and proposes exercises and questions
 for deepening the understanding of DCT.
 
\end_layout

The remainder of this paper offers a short recap of the definition of the
 DCT and its application in JPEG in section

This section gives a brief overview of the related work from definition
 of DCT in 1974 via the JPEG standard from 1992 to todays usage of JPEG.

\begin_layout Subsection
DCT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to its original paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ahmed_discrete_1974"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 from 1974, DCT was defined as a tool in digital image processing for the
 purpose of feature selection in pattern recognition and for scalar-type
 Wiener filtering.
 The goal was to create an orthogonal transform along with an algorithm
 that allows its fast computation.
 After the mathematical definition of the DCT, the paper develops an algorithm
 which uses the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as the basis for the DCT and
 its inverse operation, the IDCT.
 The paper states, that DCT can be used in multiple dimensions, that is,
 the rows and columns of an image.
 Nevertheless, it does not mention the idea of using DCT for image compression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
JPEG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JPEG is today's de facto standard for lossy image compression of real-life
 photography material in consumer electronics, multimedia applications,
 and the World Wide Web in general.
 It uses DCT at its very core.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1992 JPEG standard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 defines two classes of encoding and decoding processes, lossless and lossy
 processes.
 For us, the latter ones are of interest, as these use DCT for compression
 and decompression.

The part we take a closer look at in this paper is the 
\emph on
Forward DCT
\emph default
 (denoted FDCT), and its counterpart in the decoder, the 
\emph on
Inverse DCT
\emph default
 (IDCT).
 In the simplest amongst the DCT-based processes, the 
\emph on
baseline sequential
\emph default
 process, the encoder separates the image into blocks of 8 by 8 pixels and
 feeds every single into the FDCT.
 The FDCT's result comprises 64 coefficients representing the frequency
 domain projection of the spatial domain image block.

In section A.3 the standard defines details for the FDCT.
 Inside a block, the pixels are referenced by a two-part index.
 The index components 
\emph on
x
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
y
\emph default
 denote the pixel's horizontal and vertical position, from left to right,
 and from top to bottom, starting with 0 for both components.
 That section also gives an

 The indexes

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relatively simple structures of these equations provide a good opportunity
 for a coding exercise that aims to implement FDCT and IDCT of one 8 by

 This, however is not in scope of this paper.

Matrix Visualization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DCT is a transformation on a matrix, yielding another matrix.
 In order to create the image representation of a matrix, the application
 creates an image of the same size in pixels as the matrix has components.
 One image pixel corresponds to one matrix component in the same row and
 column as the pixel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each component of both matrices is a real number, thus it has decimal digits
 and a sign, which may be negative.
 We can not just use the component value for the brightness of a pixel,
 since contemporary computer displays can not show negative brightness,
 and positive brightness is limited to integer values from 0 to 255 inclusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application offers multiple strategies to overcome this crucial limitation,
 amongst which the user may choose one in each image window's

grey will uniformly and linearly scale the matrix values such that their
 resulting brightness exactly fits into the range 0 to 255, if any component
 exceeds these values.
 In image processing terms, this roughly corresponds to an automatic contrast
 and brightness correction.

, which recommends a conversion to a grayscale image using a logarithmic
 scale.
 In order to avoid the impossible calculation of the logarithm of values
 less than one, he introduces the addition of 1 before the log operation.
 This way, the intuitive mapping of component value 0 to pixel brightness
 0 is still intact.
 The actual implementation employs automatic contrast adaption after that,
 in order to use the maximum brightness value 255.

 for an example.
 Positive component values use yellow color, negative values use cyan, zero

\color red
TODO: the following explanation into a separate section, maybe technical
 stuff?
\color inherit
 We choose these colors with contemporary RGB displays and human perception
 in mind, and we aim for high brightness and contrast, while still retaining
 good color separation for positive and negative signs.
 The green color component of pixels in these displays is the color with
 the best reception and resolution in the human eye 
\color red
TODO:REF_something
\color inherit
, yielding high brightness and contrast.
 We use green for both signs in order to leverage these favorable attributes
 in all cases.
 With the same brightness, we add either red or blue, depending on the sign.
 This has multiple advantages.
 We further gain brightness and contrast, vital for visual value estimation.
 We leave a minimum of available brightness and contrast capability of the
 display unused.
 We achieve high color separation, due to red and blue being on opposite
 sides of green in the color spectrum.
 We add no crosstalk, because we use a separate display sub-pixel per sign.

Brush Window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interactive manipulation of a matrix via its image representation inside
 an image window uses the brush metaphor.
 Pressing the primary mouse button (PMB) while the mouse pointer is inside
 the image viewport will modify the matrix by applying the brush's primary
 function, the secondary mouse button (SMB) applies the brush's secondary
 function, respectively.
 Dragging the mouse pointer while pressing a mouse button will repeat the
 function once for every matrix component entered with the mouse pointer,
 thus enabling a natural way of painting on the matrix.
\end_layout

 I will therefore increase the component value by one fourth when using
 the PMB and reduce it by one fifth when applied by the SMB.

Exercises
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is a collection of exercises covering basic topics of DCT and
 its application in JPEG.
 These exercises can also serve as a basis for classroom demonstration or
 deepening self-studies.
 In each exercise we introduce the context, give instructions to reconstruct
 the situation under discussion.
 A set of images helps to clear out ambiguities.
 In addition to that, we pose additional questions in order to excite the
 students' curiosity.
 The instructions often refer to the Spatial Domain (SD), Spatial Domain
 Image (SDI), Frequency Domain (FD), and the Frequency Domain Image (FDI),
 using the respective abbreviations.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Identity Matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identity matrix clearly shows the matrix transformation nature of the
 DCT.
 When loaded into the SD or the FD, the resulting matrix is always the identity
 matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: Load the example image identity-8 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Identity-matrix"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) into either one matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions: Are there any other simple matrices showing visual
 similarities in the SDI and FDI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
JPEG DCT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JPEG compression feeds 8 by 8 blocks of pixels into an FDCT to obtain the
 FD matrix.
 Similarly, the decompression feeds an 8 by 8 matrix into its IDCT in order
 to reconstruct the SDI.
 Visual explanations of these step often use a diagram showing a grid of
 SDI patterns that every single FD component adds to the image 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "_file:dctjpeg.png_????,_discrete_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This application allows to reproduce the elements of these diagrams interactive
ly.
 Furthermore, one can study the superposition of the patterns from multiple
 coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: Configure a size 1 square brush with value 255 in 
\emph on
set/zero
\emph default
 mode.
 Set SDI visualization to 
\emph on
yellow/cyan
\emph default
.
 Apply the PMB on single components of the FDI, use SMB to remove the value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions: What is the effect of FD component in row 0, column
 0 on the SDI? How do FD components n/0 and 0/n relate to each other (see
 figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:JPEG-DCT:-SDI02"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:JPEG-DCT:-SDI20"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for n=2)? How and why is the SDI for the combination of FDI n/0 and 0/n
 different to n/n alone (see figures
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:JPEG-DCT:-SDI0220"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:JPEG-DCT:-SDI22"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for n=2)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
JPEG Quantization Loss / Low-Pass Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JPEG compression is lossy due to the quantization step after the FDCT.
 This step basically discards high-frequency components with small absolute
 values, in other terms, it is a low-pass filter.
 When losing too much information, the decompressed image shows blurred
 edges, blocky colors, ringing, and other types of artifacts.
 We can simulate this loss of information in quantization and immediately
 see its effect in the SDI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: In an SDI window, open example image lena-512 in an SDI window,
 
\emph on
zoom to original size
\emph default
, choose visualization 
\emph on
original
\emph default
.
 Configure a size 80 square brush and choose mode 
\emph on
set/zero
\emph default
.
 In an FDI set visualization 
\emph on
log-gray
\emph default
.
 In that FDI, start applying the brush in the bottom right corner.
 Press and hold SMB and start sweeping in a diagonal direction from bottom-left
 to top-right and back.
 While still sweeping, slowly advance to the top-left corner, deleting lower
 and lower frequencies (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Low-pass:-60"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 You are most likely to see no detrimental effect in the SDI up until the
 point where the bottom-right half of the FDI is cleared.
 Keep sweeping and watch closely as the first artifacts become visible (figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Low-pass:-SDI90"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions: What is similar or different to the effect seen before,
 if one starts clearing coefficients at the bottom edge of the FDI, sweeping
 from left to right and back, slowly moving to the top?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edge detection / High-Pass Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edges in SDI correspond to high amplitudes in high-frequency coefficients.
 One can use this property to find edges by manipulating the FDI mimicking
 a high-pass filter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: In an SDI window, open example image lena-512 in an SDI window,
 choose visualization 
\emph on
auto-contrast/brightness
\emph default
.
 Configure a size 240 hard circle brush and choose mode 
\emph on
set/zero
\emph default
.
 In an FDI apply the brush by SMB at component 0/0 (figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:High-pass:-FDI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The SDI immediately shows highlighted edges (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:High-pass:-SDI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions: How does the brush size influence the kind of edges
 this method finds? When clearing the coefficient 0/0 only, how does it
 change the character of the filter operation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Large-Scale Self-Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise: Create a new matrix of size 256 by 256.
 Configure brush size 32, 
\emph on
hard circle
\emph default
 shape, value 255, mode 
\emph on
add/subtract
\emph default
.
 Choose 
\emph on
log-gray
\emph default
 matrix visualization for SDI and FDI.
 Apply the brush in SDI at 128/128 using PMB.
 This produces a pattern of dozens of wiggly lines and loops in the FDI.
 Now apply the brush in the FDI at 128/128.
 Now SDI (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Self-Similarity:-SDI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and FDI show striking similarities.
 Question: What are the major reasons for this result?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional questions: What patterns do you expect when applying the other
 brush types instead? Or different brush sizes?

\begin_layout Standard
We have created an interactive application presenting DCT in an image processing
 context.
 The application is suitable for classroom demonstration, as well as exercise
 assignment and self-studies.
 In order to aid all three scenarios, we provide a set of exercises covering
 a range of basic topics of DCT and its application in JPEG.
 An extensive user manual explains all options, functions, and their rationale.
 The technical section gives an overview of the components involved in creating
 the application and a rough outline of what it takes to re-build the applicatio
n from its sources.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we deem the application feature complete regarding the initial plan,
 we present an informal list of ideas that did not make it into the application,
 but can be part of anyones future work.
 Allow switching to FFT (additional phase-image) or wavelet transformation
 (JPEG 2000 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "_jpeg_2018-1"

\end_inset

).
 Replace calling the OpenCV DCT with your own implementation, or with an
 interface, so that many students can implement the DCT algorithm in a single
 method, as part of an exercise assignment.
 Enable importing CSV files.
 Add a simple way to copy the SD matrix to FDI or vice-versa.
 Make the brush border visible while hovering over the image representations.
 Apply DCT or any of the other transforms to audio data, with graphical
 representations of amplitude over time and frequency spectrum over time,
 and similar interactive manipulation of these representations.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have successfully created the interactive application we planned in the
 beginning.
 We are confident that it aids in teaching and in understanding DCT in a
 visual way, not only by supporting the exercises we deliver in this paper,
 but also by offering the freedom to load arbitrary images and manipulate
 these using the brush.
 On top of that, we encourage anyone who is interested to extend this set
 of learning material in any useful way.
 Therefore we release the source code of the application, and the source
 code and imagess of this paper, under a GPL license on github.
