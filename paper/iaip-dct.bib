	abstract = {This article presents near-optimal guarantees for accurate and robust image recovery from under-sampled noisy measurements using total variation minimization. In particular, we show that from O(slog(N)) nonadaptive linear measurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-term approximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor can be removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove a strengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space of suitably incoherent matrices.},

	abstract = {A joint {ISO}/{CCITT} committee known as {JPEG} (Joint Photographic Experts Group) has been working to establish the first international compression standard for continuous-tone still images, both grayscale and color. {JPEG}'s proposed standard aims to be generic, to support a wide variety of applications for continuous-tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the {JPEG} standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A {DCT} (discrete cosine transform)-based method is specified for `lossy' compression, and a predictive method for `lossless' compression. {JPEG} features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other {DCT}-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented {JPEG} method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications. The author provides an overview of the {JPEG} standard, and focuses in detail on the Baseline method},

	abstract = {{JPEG} ( {JAY}-peg) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. {JPEG} typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.
{JPEG} compression is used in a number of image file formats. {JPEG}/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with {JPEG}/{JFIF}, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called {JPEG}.
The term "{JPEG}" is an initialism/acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard. The {MIME} media type for {JPEG} is image/jpeg, except in older Internet Explorer versions, which provides a {MIME} type of image/pjpeg when uploading {JPEG} images. {JPEG} files usually have a filename extension of .jpg or .jpeg.
{JPEG}/{JFIF} supports a maximum image size of 65,535×65,535 pixels, hence up to 4 gigapixels for an aspect ratio of 1:1.},

	abstract = {A discrete cosine transform ({DCT}) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. {DCTs} are important to numerous applications in science and engineering, from lossy compression of audio (e.g. {MP}3) and images (e.g. {JPEG}) (where small high-frequency components can be discarded), to spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out (as described below) that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions.
In particular, a {DCT} is a Fourier-related transform similar to the discrete Fourier transform ({DFT}), but using only real numbers. The {DCTs} are generally related to Fourier Series coefficients of a periodically and symmetrically extended sequence whereas {DFTs} are related to Fourier Series coefficients of a periodically extended sequence. {DCTs} are equivalent to {DFTs} of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry (since the Fourier transform of a real and even function is real and even), whereas in some variants the input and/or output data are shifted by half a sample. There are eight standard {DCT} variants, of which four are common.
The most common variant of discrete cosine transform is the type-{II} {DCT}, which is often called simply "the {DCT}". Its inverse, the type-{III} {DCT}, is correspondingly often called simply "the inverse {DCT}" or "the {IDCT}". Two related transforms are the discrete sine transform ({DST}), which is equivalent to a {DFT} of real and odd functions, and the modified discrete cosine transform ({MDCT}), which is based on a {DCT} of overlapping data. Multidimensional {DCTs} ({MD} {DCTs}) are developed to extend the concept of {DCT} on {MD} Signals. There are several algorithms to compute {MD} {DCT}. A new variety of fast algorithms are also developed to reduce the computational complexity of implementing {DCT}.},

	abstract = {{JPEG} 2000 ({JP}2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based {JPEG} standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for {ISO}/{IEC} 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as {ISO}/{IEC} 15444-2. The registered {MIME} types are defined in {RFC} 3745. For {ISO}/{IEC} 15444-1 it is image/jp2.
{JPEG} 2000 code streams are regions of interest that offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity. It is possible to store different parts of the same picture using different quality.
As of 2018, there are very few digital cameras that encode photos in the {JPEG} 2000 format, and many applications for viewing and editing photos still do not support it.},
