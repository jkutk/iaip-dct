	abstract = {This article presents near-optimal guarantees for accurate and robust image recovery from under-sampled noisy measurements using total variation minimization. In particular, we show that from O(slog(N)) nonadaptive linear measurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-term approximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor can be removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove a strengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space of suitably incoherent matrices.},

	abstract = {A joint {ISO}/{CCITT} committee known as {JPEG} (Joint Photographic Experts Group) has been working to establish the first international compression standard for continuous-tone still images, both grayscale and color. {JPEG}'s proposed standard aims to be generic, to support a wide variety of applications for continuous-tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the {JPEG} standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A {DCT} (discrete cosine transform)-based method is specified for `lossy' compression, and a predictive method for `lossless' compression. {JPEG} features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other {DCT}-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented {JPEG} method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications. The author provides an overview of the {JPEG} standard, and focuses in detail on the Baseline method},

It is shown that the discrete cosine transform can be used in the area of digital processing for the purposes of pattern recognition and Wiener filtering. Its performance is compared with that of a class of orthogonal transforms and is found to compare closely to that of the Karhunen-Loève transform, which is known to be optimal. The performances of the Karhunen-Loève and discrete cosine transforms are also found to compare closely with respect to the rate-distortion criterion.},
